# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis

This project focused on using Python to analyze the (partially fictionalized) data of Instacart, an online grocery app, in order to gain insights on how they can improve their business. They were particularly interested in developing customer profiles in order to more accurately target different market segments.

Numerous datasets were cleaned, joined, and analyzed. A number of charts and graphs were made to better visualize the findings.

The spreadsheet containing the entire process, findings, and visualizations is located in the "Sent to client" folder.
